## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create `.env` in this folder:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
PORT=3000
```

> CRA exposes only variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Default local URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📜 Scripts

- `npm start` — run development server
- `npm run build` — generate production bundle in `build/`
- `npm test` — run test watcher

## 🧭 App Routes

- `/` — Home
- `/hotels` — Hotel listing / search
- `/hotels/:id` — Hotel details + reserve flow
- `/my-bookings` — User booking history
- `/account` — User account center
- `/login`
- `/register`

## 🔌 Backend Integration

The frontend calls backend routes under `/api/...` using `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`.

Architecture highlights:

- `AuthContext` for login state and user session data
- `SearchContext` for destination, dates, and filter options
- `useFetch` for shared loading/error/data fetching logic
- Reusable component composition across all route pages

## 🔄 Key User Flows

### Reservation Flow

1. User picks dates and room options
2. Unavailable room dates are blocked in UI
3. Booking request sent to backend
4. Conflict (`409`) is shown with user-facing feedback

### My Bookings

- Loads current user bookings
- Displays date range, status, room count, and total price
- Allows cancellation of active bookings
- Splits bookings into active/upcoming and past history
- Supports history filters: `All`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`
- Allows rating/review submission for completed stays

### My Account

- Shows saved profile details in read-only mode
- `Edit Profile` enables update flow
- `Security Center` supports password change with strength indicator and show/hide controls

### Registration Validation

- Searchable country/city selects
- Client-side email validation before submit
- Backend handles final validation + uniqueness checks

## 🎨 UI Improvements Included

- Upgraded spacing and typography
- Cleaner card layouts and section hierarchy
- Better navbar actions (bookings/logout)
- Username dropdown with `My Account`, `My Bookings`, `Logout`
- More robust image rendering fallback behavior

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- **App not starting**: ensure port `3000` is free
- **API calls failing**: verify backend is running on `5000`
- **Auth issues**: check backend CORS + credentials settings
- **Missing images**: confirm files exist in `public/images`

## 🚢 Deployment Notes

- Build with `npm run build`
- Serve static output from `build/`
- Set backend `CLIENT_URL` to deployed frontend origin
- Validate cookie/session behavior over HTTPS

## ✅ QA Checklist

- [ ] Register/Login/Logout works end-to-end
- [ ] Featured counts render correctly
- [ ] Booking conflict path shows clear `409` message
- [ ] My Bookings lists user data and allows cancel
- [ ] Image fallback behavior works
